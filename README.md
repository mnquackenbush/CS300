What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The projects for this course were focused on determining the most efficient data structure to use (in terms of both organizational context and runtime efficiency)
to suit the needs of a program that would be used to look up various courses' information for a university system. The program would need to be able to load the various courses
into the selected structure from a CSV file, and then be able to print all the courses from the data structure in alphanumeric order, as well as to search the data structure
for a specified course (according to its course ID).

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

In earlier modules of the course, I worked with various data structures (Vectors, Linked Lists, Hash Tables, and Binary Search Trees) to better understand their strengths and
weaknesses, as well as the details of their respective implementations. This gave me a better context to understand which data structures would be best suited towards certain
needs. For the final projects of the course, I was able to use the context gained in experimenting with the various data structures to determine that a Hash Table would be best
suited for the needs of the program, and then implement that structure in the code of the final project.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Acknowledging that my current approach wasn't working when I came across a roadblock was the first step. From there, I would usually consult back to the appropriate section of the 
textbook to try and find a solution that fit the needs of the problem, but that often wasn't enough to resolve the issues. Many times, it required me consulting resources like Stack Overflow
or various code assistants to break down for me what about my code wasn't working properly, and find the guidance to point me in the right direction.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This course has made it more apparent to me in developing software that oftentimes there is far more than one solution to any given problem, and the process of determining which solution is
the best fit isn't always clear cut. For example, for the final project of the course, any of the above data structures could be used to address the problem, but choosing which one would be
most efficient and appropriate for the needs of the program was the main crux of the work.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Using pre-established methods in formatting my code (including commenting each section, intuitive variable naming conventions, and using pseudocode to structure code before writing it) has
helped me to get in the habit of writing code that not only works, but is also far easier to return to after a while and continue to build upon.
